# QRIS Transaction Forecasting Using SARIMAX

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting the **volume and nominal value of QRIS transactions in Indonesia** using the **Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX)** model. The analysis incorporates external explanatory variables and is complemented by a **survey-based validation** of cashless payment behavior among university students.

The project is developed as part of an undergraduate thesis in Mathematics.

## Research Objective
The primary objectives of this study are:
- To model and forecast QRIS transaction volume and nominal value using SARIMAX.
- To examine the role of exogenous variables in improving forecasting performance.
- To validate forecasting results through survey data on student cashless payment behavior.

## Data Description
The analysis uses:
- Monthly QRIS transaction data (volume and nominal value).
- Exogenous variables related to QRIS adoption and merchant growth.
- Survey data collected from university students to validate cashless behavior patterns.

The time series data span multiple periods and are structured for forecasting analysis.

## Methodology
The analytical workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and transformation.
- Stationarity testing and seasonal pattern identification.
- SARIMAX model specification and estimation.
- Model evaluation and comparison.
- Interpretation of forecasting results.
- Descriptive analysis of survey data for behavioral validation.

The study emphasizes the integration of quantitative forecasting results with behavioral insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels)
- Google Colab
- Microsoft Excel
- Survey data collection and processing tools

## Project Context
This repository documents the full analytical process supporting the undergraduate thesis titled:

**“Peramalan Volume dan Nominal Transaksi QRIS di Indonesia Menggunakan Model SARIMAX dengan Variabel Eksogen dan Validasi Survei Perilaku Cashless Mahasiswa.”**
